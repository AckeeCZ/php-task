# php-task
Welcome to our testing task!

This time we will test some php-core skills.

There is a file buggycode.php that contains some very ugly code that should never be used. Then there are some bugs and some not-so-nice things.

Find these issues, fix them, explain in a comment what is wrong and why.

Happy hacking!
